Polymorphism in C++

1. Similar to Polymorphism in Life.
2. Polymorphism = Many Forms.
3. The ability of a single function or operator to work in different ways based on the object it is acting upon or actual need.
4. A phenomenon that allows an object to have several different forms and behaviours.
5. Types:
   1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static)
   2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic)

Example :------------------
(Real-life analogy - Rahul):
- Rahul has many roles:
   - Parent ⇄ Rahul ⇄ Parent
   - Rahul ⇄ Wife
   - Rahul → Child
   - Rahul → Son
   - Rahul ⇄ Sibling (Sis/Bro)

This shows that one object (Rahul) can take on MULTIPLE FORMS based on the context — just like polymorphism in C++.
------------------------- 

--> So, polymorphism, can be done in 2 ways : 
(i) Function Overloading
(ii) Operator Overloading
