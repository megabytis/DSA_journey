*** ABSTRACTION in CPP ***
    ==================

ସିଧା କଥା, in real life ଯାହା ବି ଆମେ ବ୍ୟବହାର କରୁଛନ୍ତି, ସେଇଟା backend ରେ କାମ କେମିତି କରୁଛି ଆମେ ଜାଣି ନାହାନ୍ତି 
e.g. any Application, any laptop, computer, mobilephone, watch etc...

-> in cpp also This ABSTRACTION do exist ;

### Abstraction in Header files

1. Function’s implementation is hidden in header files.  
2. We could use the same program without knowing its inside working / backside hidden programs  
3. E.g., `Sort`, for example, is used to sort an array, a list, or a collection of items, and we know that if we give a container to sort, 
   it will sort it, but we don’t know which sorting algorithm it uses to sort that container / how the sort function works bts .
