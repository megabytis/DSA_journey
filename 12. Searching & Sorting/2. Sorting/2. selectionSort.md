Initial Array: [5, 2, 8, 2, 0, 4]

logic of swap : find smallest in each iteration nd swap it with i'th item .

ITERATION 1:
- Starting at index 0
- Assume v[0] = 5 as the smallest
- Compare with v[1] = 2 → new smallest = 2 (index 1)
- Compare with v[2] = 8 → no change
- Compare with v[3] = 2 → new smallest = 2 (index 3)
- Compare with v[4] = 0 → new smallest = 0 (index 4)
- Compare with v[5] = 4 → no change
- Swap v[0] and v[4]
→ Array becomes: [0, 2, 8, 2, 5, 4]

ITERATION 2:
- Starting at index 1
- Assume v[1] = 2 as the smallest
- Compare with v[2] = 8 → no change
- Compare with v[3] = 2 → same value, no index update
- Compare with v[4] = 5 → no change
- Compare with v[5] = 4 → no change
- No swap needed
→ Array remains: [0, 2, 8, 2, 5, 4]

ITERATION 3:
- Starting at index 2
- Assume v[2] = 8 as the smallest
- Compare with v[3] = 2 → new smallest = 2 (index 3)
- Compare with v[4] = 5 → no change
- Compare with v[5] = 4 → no change
- Swap v[2] and v[3]
→ Array becomes: [0, 2, 2, 8, 5, 4]

ITERATION 4:
- Starting at index 3
- Assume v[3] = 8 as the smallest
- Compare with v[4] = 5 → new smallest = 5 (index 4)
- Compare with v[5] = 4 → new smallest = 4 (index 5)
- Swap v[3] and v[5]
→ Array becomes: [0, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8]

ITERATION 5:
- Starting at index 4
- Assume v[4] = 5 as the smallest
- Compare with v[5] = 8 → no change
- No swap needed
→ Array remains: [0, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8]

✅ Final Sorted Array: [0, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8]
