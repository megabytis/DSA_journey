Searching and Finding Algorithm:

1. std::binary_search: Checks if a value exists in a sorted range.
Time Complexity: O(log n)


2. std::lower_bound: Finds the first element greater or equal to a value in a sorted range.
Time Complexity: O(log n)


3. std::upper_bound: Finds the first element greater than a value in a sorted range.
Time Complexity: O(log n)


4. std::equal_range: Finds a range of elements equal to a value in a sorted range.
Time Complexity: O(log n)
