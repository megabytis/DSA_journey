Heap Algorithms :

1. std::make_heap: Converts a range into a max-heap.
Time Complexity: O(n)

2. std::push_heap: Inserts an element into a max-heap.
Time Complexity: O(log n)

3. std::pop_heap: Removes the largest element from a max-heap.
Time Complexity: O(log n)

4. std::sort_heap: Sorts a range that represents a max-heap.
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
