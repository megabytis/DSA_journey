# Iterators and Iterating Algorithms:

1. std::for_each: Applies a function to each element in a range.

2. std::find: Searches for a specific element in a range.

3. std::find_if: Searches for the first element that satisfies a given predicate.

4. std::count: Counts the occurrences of a value in a range.

5. std::count_if: Counts the elements that satisfy a given predicate.

6. std::sort: Sorts the elements in a range in ascending order.

7. std::reverse: Reverses the order of elements in a range.

8. std::rotate: Rotates elements in a range.

9. std::unique: Removes duplicate elements from a sorted range.

10. std::partition: Divides elements in a range into two groups based on a predicate.
