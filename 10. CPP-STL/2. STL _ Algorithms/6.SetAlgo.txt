Set Algorithms : 

1. std::set_union: Computes the union of two sorted ranges.
Time Complexity: O(2*(m+n)-1) where m and n are the sizes of the input ranges.

2. std::set_intersection: Computes the intersection of two sorted ranges.
Time Complexity: O(2*(m+n)-1)

3. std::set_difference: Computes the difference between two sorted ranges.
Time Complexity: O(2*(m+n)-1)

4. std::set_symmetric_difference: Computes the symmetric difference of two sorted ranges.
Time Complexity: O(2*(m+n)-1)
