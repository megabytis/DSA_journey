# Functors in C++

## What Are Functors?
- Functors are objects that behave like functions.
- They are implemented as classes or structs that overload the `operator()`.

## Key Characteristics
- Behave like functions when called.
- Can encapsulate behavior and state.

## Functors in the STL
- Used extensively in STL algorithms for custom behavior.
- Commonly used as custom comparators or operations.

## Usage in Algorithms
- Passed as arguments to STL algorithms.
- Example: Custom sorting based on specific attributes.

## Function Call Operator (`operator()`)
- Defines the behavior of the functor when called.
- Allows encapsulation of custom logic.

## Why Use Functors?
- Flexibility and reusability.
- Seamless integration with STL.

sort() ର କାମ ascending order ରେ Integer ମାନଙ୍କୁ ସଜେଇ ଦେବା,
କିନ୍ତୁ ଏୟା ଭିତରେ କିଛି letter , words , names , pass କଲେ ଇୟେ ଆଉ sort କରିପାରିବନି |
ତ ଆମେ ଗୋଟେ specific function class a.k.a. FUNCTOR ବନେଇକି ଛାଡି ଦେଲେ with specific task,
in future ତାକୁ direct use କରିପାରିବା like sort() funcion :)
