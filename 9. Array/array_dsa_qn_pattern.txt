----- there r many types of qns can be formed like below -----

* Elementary Traversal and Modification

Sum of elements
Finding minimum/maximum
Counting occurrences of an element
Reversing an array
Rotate an array



* Sorting and Searching

Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap)
Binary search on sorted arrays
Counting sort (for special cases where elements are in a limited range)
Search fora given element (linear and binary search)
Find the kth smallest/largest element



* Two-pointer Techniques

Finding pairs with a specific sum (e.g., two sum problem)
Reversing an array in-place
Merging two sorted arrays
Partitioning an array (used in quicksort)
Sliding window problems (e.g., maximum sum subarray of size k)



* Dynamic Programming

Maximum/Minimum sum subarray
Longest increasing subsequence
Coin change problem
Knapsack problem variants
Number of ways to sum up to a target (subset sum problem)



* Hashing and Counting

Frequency count of elements
Finding duplicates or missing numbers
Grouping or categorizing data
Longest consecutive sequence




* Divide and Conquer

Quick sort
Merge sort
Binary search
Find peak element
Closest pair of points (using divide and conquer in multidimensional arrays)


* Matrix Problems

Matrix rotation and flipping
Spiral order traversal
Searching in a row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix
Matrix multiplication
Path finding problems (e.g., number of paths from top-left to bottom-right)



* Cycle Detection

Detecting cycle in an array (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare)
Find the repeating and missing numbers



* Miscellaneous Complex Patterns

Rearrange array according to given indexes
Rearrange array in-place with O(1) extra space
Shuffle an array
Stock buy and sell to maximize profit (single or multiple transactions)
Reorder array according to given indexes



* Stacks and Queues using Arrays

Next greater/smaller element
Implementing a min-stack
Implementing queues using stacks and vice versa
Histogram related problems (e.g., largest rectangle in histogram)



* Graph-related

Adjacency matrix representation and operations
Transitive closure of a graph (using Floyd-Warshall algorithm )
Shortest path in weighted/unweighted graph
