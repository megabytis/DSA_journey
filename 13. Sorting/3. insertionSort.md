Initial Array: [5, 2, 8, 2, 0, 4]

PASS 1:
- Consider element at index 1 → key = 2
- Compare with 5 → 5 > 2 → shift right
- Insert 2 at correct position
→ Array becomes: [2, 5, 8, 2, 0, 4]

PASS 2:
- Consider element at index 2 → key = 8
- Compare with 5 → 5 < 8 → stop
- No shift needed
→ Array remains: [2, 5, 8, 2, 0, 4]

PASS 3:
- Consider element at index 3 → key = 2
- Compare with 8 → 8 > 2 → shift right
- Compare with 5 → 5 > 2 → shift right
- Compare with 2 → 2 <= 2 → stop
- Insert 2 after first 2
→ Array becomes: [2, 2, 5, 8, 0, 4]

PASS 4:
- Consider element at index 4 → key = 0
- Compare with 8 → shift right
- Compare with 5 → shift right
- Compare with 2 → shift right
- Compare with 2 → shift right
- Insert 0 at beginning
→ Array becomes: [0, 2, 2, 5, 8, 4]

PASS 5:
- Consider element at index 5 → key = 4
- Compare with 8 → 8 > 4 → shift right
- Compare with 5 → 5 > 4 → shift right
- Compare with 2 → 2 < 4 → stop
- Insert 4 after 2
→ Array becomes: [0, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8]

✅ Final Sorted Array: [0, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8]
